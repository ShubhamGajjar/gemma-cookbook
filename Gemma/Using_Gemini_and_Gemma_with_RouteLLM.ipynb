Built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models, Gemma models are text-to-text, decoder-only large language models (LLMs), available in English, with open weights, pre-trained variants, and instruction-tuned variants.\n",
        "Gemma models are well-suited for various text-generation tasks, including question-answering, summarization, and reasoning. Their relatively small size makes it possible to deploy them in environments with limited resources such as a laptop, desktop, or cloud infrastructure, democratizing access to state-of-the-art AI models and helping foster innovation for everyone.\n",

        "[Gemini](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/) is a large language model developed by Google AI. It is a multimodal model, meaning it can process and generate text, code, images, and audio. Gemini is considered one of the most advanced language models available, and it has been shown to outperform other models on various tasks, such as question answering, summarization, and translation.\n",

        "[RouteLLM](https://github.com/lm-sys/RouteLLM) is a framework that helps you optimize your LLM usage by routing queries to the most appropriate model based on their complexity.
