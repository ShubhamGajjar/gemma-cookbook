Subject: Birthday Party Cake Request

Hello!

I would like to order a cake for my son who is turning 6 next week. He would love chocolate cake with strawberry filling and a race car on top. We will be having a party with 8 kids total.

Please recommend a cake size and provide an estimated cost. Thank you!
