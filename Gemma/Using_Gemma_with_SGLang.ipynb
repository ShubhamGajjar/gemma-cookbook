        "\n",
        "[Gemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma) is a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open-source language models from Google. Built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models, Gemma models are text-to-text, decoder-only large language models (LLMs), available in English, with open weights, pre-trained variants, and instruction-tuned variants.\n",
        "Gemma models are well-suited for various text-generation tasks, including question-answering, summarization, and reasoning. Their relatively small size makes it possible to deploy them in environments with limited resources such as a laptop, desktop, or your cloud infrastructure, democratizing access to state-of-the-art AI models and helping foster innovation for everyone.\n",
